About the project:
This was a group project among the members listed in the header. The project
was to solve Sudoku puzzles using a search type method. In addition, a short
paper has been provided as a write-up for what we did to solve this problem.
There are four different implementations these are:

1) stupid
2) monkey
3) brains
4) searchNxN

How to run:
To run the implementations use sudokuSolver.py. Do not use the the
implementation files by themselves! Instead type
"sudokuSolver.py -flag < inputFile" on the command line. -flag is a given flag,
a, b, c, or d to select the implementation you want to use, and inputFile is a
text file containting one or more sudoku puzzles. If you do not include the inputFile,
then you will be prompted for one. If no flags are given then a help message
will be supplied.
